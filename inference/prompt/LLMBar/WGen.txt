You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction.

Please propose respective importance weightage for three aspects in evaluating the output.

Here are some rules of the evaluation:
(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction.
(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.

# Instruction:
{input}

# Aspects:
Here are at most three questions about the outputs:
{auxiliary_input_0}

# Requirements for Your Output:
(1) The weightages should be in percentage form and sum up to 100%. 
(2) You should directly give the weightages without any other words. 
(3) You should give weightages in the same line, separated by space.
